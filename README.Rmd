# Documentation

The Freshwater Health Index (FHI) offers a framework for water managers and decision-makers to analyze the health of their basins, understand the trade-offs and consequences of their actions, and discuss approaches to creating healthy, sustainable watersheds into the future. FHI Users are encouraged to visit [FHI's documentation](https://www.conservation.org/projects/freshwater-health-index) to learn more on FHI functionalities and capabilities. 



## Installation

You can install the development version of FHI like so:

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github("Nick-Souter/FHI", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library(FHI)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to calculate deviation from natural flow (DvNF) for modeled flow/gauge height data:

```{r example, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(FHI)

DvNF_model()

```
